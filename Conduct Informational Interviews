Conduct Informational Interviews

You've made some connections at meetups or via LinkedIn. Some of them are experts i.e. they are people with some experience in the field who can give you significant insights. It's now time to put your skills to practice and talk to them about their roles and their companies.

Find 5 experts who might be able to give you more insight into your job leads. 
Reach out to them and ask them out for coffee (or a phone call)
Once you've talked to them, summarize what you've learned. Are you still interested in that company/role?
Repeat steps 1-3 until you've talked to at least 3 experts.
Note: Don't get disheartened if you don't hear back from some people. It's perfectly normal! Like all other skills, you'll get better with practice.

Submit: Update your notes about this company/role in your spreadsheet.
