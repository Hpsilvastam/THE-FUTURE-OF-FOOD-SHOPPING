First Data Science Meetup

I went to my first Data Science event on August 3rd. The group was 
there to see how a Data Science teacher used his knowledge to improve 
his performance on a very popular brazilian fantasy game called Cartolas FC
A lot of people backed out, but I was still able to do some networking.
It became clear once again that the job market is looking for senior professionals
but there are just a few novices trying to understand what is Data Science.
